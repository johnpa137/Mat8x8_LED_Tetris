# Mat8x8_LED_Tetris
Tetris on De1_SoC using 8x8 LEDs

A final project I had for EE 271 at UW.
Decided to do Tetris. 

Note: When looking through old files there were multiple versions of this project one works and one doesn't
  I no longer have a De1_SoC to test which is which, v2 was the last modified version and was likely the final version that was turned-in
